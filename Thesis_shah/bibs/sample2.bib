abstract = {Autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis by targeting damaged organelles, pathogens, or misfolded protein aggregates for lysosomal degradation. The autophagic process is initiated by the formation of autophagosomes, which can selectively enclose cargo via autophagy cargo receptors. A machinery of well-characterized autophagy-related proteins orchestrates the biogenesis of autophagosomes; however, the origin of the required membranes is incompletely understood. Here, we have applied sensitized pooled CRISPR screens and identify the uncharacterized transmembrane protein TMEM41B as a novel regulator of autophagy. In the absence of TMEM41B, autophagosome biogenesis is stalled, LC3 accumulates at WIPI2- and DFCP1-positive isolation membranes, and lysosomal flux of autophagy cargo receptors and intracellular bacteria is impaired. In addition to defective autophagy, TMEM41B knockout cells display significantly enlarged lipid droplets and reduced mobilization and $\beta$-oxidation of fatty acids. Immunostaining and interaction proteomics data suggest that TMEM41B localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Taken together, we propose that TMEM41B is a novel ER-localized regulator of autophagosome biogenesis and lipid mobilization.},

To define the mechanisms of selective neuronal dysfunction in SMA, we investigated the role of SMN-dependent U12 splicing events in the regulation of motor circuit activity. We show that SMN deficiency perturbs splicing and decreases the expression of a subset of U12 intron-containing genes in mammalian cells and Drosophila larvae. Analysis of these SMN target genes identifies Stasimon as a protein required for motor circuit function. Restoration of Stasimon expression in the motor circuit corrects defects in neuromuscular junction transmission and muscle growth in Drosophila SMN mutants and aberrant motor neuron development in SMN-deficient zebrafish. These findings directly link defective splicing of critical neuronal genes induced by SMN deficiency to motor circuit dysfunction, establishing a molecular framework for the selective pathology of SMA.},

Here we use human neural progenitor cells and the neuronal cell line SK-N-BE2 in an integrated proteomics approach to characterize the cellular responses to viral infection at the proteome and phosphoproteome level, and use affinity proteomics to identify cellular targets of ZIKV proteins. Using this approach, we identify 386 ZIKV-interacting proteins, ZIKV-specific and pan-flaviviral activities as well as host factors with known functions in neuronal development, retinal defects and infertility. Moreover, our analysis identified 1,216 phosphorylation sites that are specifically up- or downregulated after ZIKV infection, indicating profound modulation of fundamental signalling pathways such as AKT, MAPK–ERK and ATM–ATR and thereby providing mechanistic insights into the proliferation arrest elicited by ZIKV infection. Functionally, our integrative study identifies ZIKV host-dependency factors and provides a comprehensive framework for a system-level understanding of ZIKV-induced perturbations at the levels of proteins and cellular pathways.},

The cellular host factors and pathways co-opted by SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in the execution of their life cycles remain ill-defined. To develop an extensive compendium of host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E), we performed parallel genome-scale CRISPR knockout screens. These screens uncovered multiple host factors and pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles, including major dependency on glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, SREBP signaling, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis, as well as an unexpected requirement for several poorly characterized proteins. We identified an absolute requirement for the VTT-domain containing protein TMEM41B for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and all other coronaviruses.

To identify host factors required for flavivirus infection, we performed full-genome loss of function CRISPR-Cas9 screens. Based on these results, we focused our efforts on characterizing the roles that TMEM41B and VMP1 play in the virus replication cycle. Our mechanistic studies on TMEM41B revealed that all members of the Flaviviridae family that we tested require TMEM41B. We tested 12 additional virus families and found that SARS-CoV-2 of the Coronaviridae also required TMEM41B for infection. Remarkably, single nucleotide polymorphisms present at nearly 20% in East Asian populations reduce flavivirus infection. Based on our mechanistic studies, we propose that TMEM41B is recruited to flavivirus RNA replication complexes to facilitate membrane curvature, which creates a protected environment for viral genome replication.},

Stasimon was shown to be required for normal neurotransmission in the motor circuit of Drosophila larvae and proper development of motor axons in zebrafish embryos as well as to suppress analogous neuronal phenotypes in SMA models of these organisms. However, the subcellular localization and molecular functions of Stasimon are poorly understood. Here, we combined immunoprecipitation with mass spectrometry to characterize the Stasimon interactome in mammalian cells, which reveals association with components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, and the COPI vesicle trafficking machinery. Expanding on the interaction results, we used subcellular fractionation studies and super-resolution microscopy to identify Stasimon as an ER-resident protein that localizes at mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAM), functionally specialized contact sites between ER and mitochondria membranes. Lastly, through characterization of novel knockout mice, we show that Stasimon is an essential gene for mouse embryonic development. Together, these findings identify Stasimon as a novel transmembrane protein component of the MAM with an essential requirement for mammalian development.},

Despite numerous reports involving these proteins in multiple cellular processes, their molecular function is still unknown. They share the domain of unknown function PF09335, suggesting a possible functional relationship between these protein families. Here we show that VMP1 from different species contain two short motifs conserved in the bacterial DedA proteins and the yeast protein Tvp38. The hallmark of one of these motifs is a glycine residue previously shown to be strictly conserved in all the DedA proteins. Substitution of this residue to leucine, glutamate or arginine in Dictyostelium Vmp1 inactivates the protein, as shown by the inability of the mutants to rescue the phenotypes associated with the lack of Vmp1 including development and lipid homeostasis. This is the first experimental approach that supports an evolutionary relationship between Vmp1 and DedA proteins and highlights the importance of the conserved glycine residue in the PF09335 domain.</p>},

abstract = {<p>The recently increasing number of atomic structures for active transporters has not only revealed strong conservation in the architecture of sequence-unrelated transporter families, but also identified a unifying element called the ‘inverted repeat topology,' which is found in nearly all transporter folds to date. Indeed, most membrane transporters consist of two or more domains with similar structure, so-called repeats. It is tempting to speculate that transporters have evolved by duplication of one repeat followed by gene fusion and modification events. An intriguing question is, whether recent genes encoding such a ‘half-transporter' still exist as independent folding units. Although it seems likely that the evolution of membrane transport proteins, which harbor internal repeats, is linked to these minimal structural building blocks, their identification in the absence of structural data represents a major challenge, as sequence homology is not an issue. In this review we discuss two protein families, the DedA family and the SWEET family, being potential half-transporters and putative ancestors for two of the most abundant secondary transporter families, the MFS family and the LeuT-fold family.</p>},

A temperature-sensitive mutant named Lud135 was isolated with mutations in two related, nonessential genes: yghB and yqjA. yghB harbors a single missense mutation (G203D) and yqjA contains a nonsense mutation (W92TGA) in Lud135. Both mutations are required for the temperature-sensitive phenotype: targeted deletion of both genes in a wild-type background results in a strain with a similar phenotype and expression of either gene from a plasmid restores growth at elevated temperatures. The mutant has altered membrane phospholipid levels, with elevated levels of acidic phospholipids, when grown under permissive conditions. Growth of Lud135 under nonpermissive conditions is restored by the presence of millimolar concentrations of divalent cations Ca(2+), Ba(2+), Sr(2+), or Mg(2+) or 300 to 500 mM NaCl but not 400 mM sucrose. Microscopic analysis of Lud135 demonstrates a dramatic defect at a late stage of cell division when cells are grown under permissive conditions. yghB and yqjA belong to the conserved and widely distributed dedA gene family, for which no function has been reported. The two open reading frames encode predicted polytopic inner membrane proteins with 61% amino acid identity. It is likely that YghB and YqjA play redundant but critical roles in membrane biology that are essential for completion of cell division in E. coli.},

We have previously shown DedA family proteins YqjA and YghB are conserved membrane transporters required for alkaline tolerance and resistance to several classes of dyes and antibiotics in Escherichia coli. Here, we show that a DedA family protein in B. thailandensis (DbcA; DedA of Burkholderia required for colistin resistance) is a membrane transporter required for resistance to colistin. Mutation of dbcA results in >100-fold greater sensitivity to colistin. Colistin resistance is often conferred via covalent modification of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) lipid A. Mass spectrometry of lipid A of ∆dbcA showed a sharp reduction of aminoarabinose in lipid A compared to wild type. Complementation of colistin sensitivity of B. thailandensis ∆dbcA was observed by expression of dbcA, E. coli yghB or E. coli yqjA. Many proton-dependent transporters possess charged amino acids in transmembrane domains that take part in the transport mechanism and are essential for function. Site directed mutagenesis of conserved and predicted membrane embedded charged amino acids suggest that DbcA functions as a proton-dependent transporter. Direct measurement of membrane potential shows that B. thailandensis $\Delta$dbcA is partially depolarized suggesting that loss of protonmotive force can lead to alterations in LPS structure and severe colistin sensitivity in this species.},

It currently offers 34 interconnected external and in-house tools, whose functionality covers sequence similarity searching, alignment construction, detection of sequence features, structure prediction, and sequence classification. This breadth has made the Toolkit an important resource for experimental biology and for teaching bioinformatic inquiry. Recently, we replaced the first version of the Toolkit, which was released in 2005 and had served around 2.5 million queries, with an entirely new version, focusing on improved features for the comprehensive analysis of proteins, as well as on promoting teaching. For instance, our popular remote homology detection server, HHpred, now allows pairwise comparison of two sequences or alignments and offers additional profile HMMs for several model organisms and domain databases. Here, we introduce the new version of our Toolkit and its application to the analysis of proteins.},

@article{Sadowski2013,
abstract = {It has been known even since relatively few structures had been solved that longer protein chains often contain multiple domains, which may fold separately and play the role of reusable functional modules found in many contexts. In many structural biology tasks, in particular structure prediction, it is of great use to be able to identify domains within the structure and analyze these regions separately. However, when using sequence data alone this task has proven exceptionally difficult, with relatively little improvement over the naive method of choosing boundaries based on size distributions of observed domains. The recent significant improvement in contact prediction provides a new source of information for domain prediction. We test several methods for using this information including a kernel smoothing-based approach and methods based on building alpha-carbon models and compare performance with a length-based predictor, a homology search method and four published sequence-based predictors: DOMCUT, DomPRO, DLP-SVM, and SCOOBY-DOmain. We show that the kernel-smoothing method is significantly better than the other ab initio predictors when both single-domain and multidomain targets are considered and is not significantly different to the homology-based method. Considering only multidomain targets the kernel-smoothing method outperforms all of the published methods except DLP-SVM. The kernel smoothing method therefore represents a potentially useful improvement to ab initio domain prediction.},

@misc{Simkovic2017,
abstract = {Evolutionary pressure on residue interactions, intramolecular or intermolecular, that are important for protein structure or function can lead to covariance between the two positions. Recent methodological advances allow much more accurate contact predictions to be derived from this evolutionary covariance signal. The practical application of contact predictions has largely been confined to structural bioinformatics, yet, as this work seeks to demonstrate, the data can be of enormous value to the structural biologist working in X-ray crystallo graphy, cryo-EM or NMR. Integrative structural bioinformatics packages such as Rosetta can already exploit contact predictions in a variety of ways. The contribution of contact predictions begins at construct design, where structural domains may need to be expressed separately and contact predictions can help to predict domain limits. Structure solution by molecular replacement (MR) benefits from contact predictions in diverse ways: in difficult cases, more accurate search models can be constructed using ab initio modelling when predictions are available, while intermolecular contact predictions can allow the construction of larger, oligomeric search models. Furthermore, MR using supersecondary motifs or large-scale screens against the PDB can exploit information, such as the parallel or antiparallel nature of any $\beta$-strand pairing in the target, that can be inferred from contact predictions. Contact information will be particularly valuable in the determination of lower resolution structures by helping to assign sequence register. In large complexes, contact information may allow the identity of a protein responsible for a certain region of density to be determined and then assist in the orientation of an available model within that density. In NMR, predicted contacts can provide long-range information to extend the upper size limit of the technique in a manner analogous but complementary to experimental methods. Finally, predicted contacts can distinguish between biologically relevant interfaces and mere lattice contacts in a final crystal structure, and have potential in the identification of functionally important regions and in foreseeing the consequences of mutations.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Protein homology detection and sequence alignment are at the basis of protein structure prediction, function prediction and evolution. RESULTS We have generalized the alignment of protein sequences with a profile hidden Markov model (HMM) to the case of pairwise alignment of profile HMMs. We present a method for detecting distant homologous relationships between proteins based on this approach. The method (HHsearch) is benchmarked together with BLAST, PSI-BLAST, HMMER and the profile-profile comparison tools PROF_SIM and COMPASS, in an all-against-all comparison of a database of 3691 protein domains from SCOP 1.63 with pairwise sequence identities below 20\%.Sensitivity: When the predicted secondary structure is included in the HMMs, HHsearch is able to detect between 2.7 and 4.2 times more homologs than PSI-BLAST or HMMER and between 1.44 and 1.9 times more than COMPASS or PROF_SIM for a rate of false positives of 10\%. Approximately half of the improvement over the profile-profile comparison methods is attributable to the use of profile HMMs in place of simple profiles. Alignment quality: Higher sensitivity is mirrored by an increased alignment quality. HHsearch produced 1.2, 1.7 and 3.3 times more good alignments ('balanced' score >0.3) than the next best method (COMPASS), and 1.6, 2.9 and 9.4 times more than PSI-BLAST, at the family, superfamily and fold level, respectively.Speed: HHsearch scans a query of 200 residues against 3691 domains in 33 s on an AMD64 2GHz PC. This is 10 times faster than PROF_SIM and 17 times faster than COMPASS.},

Evolutionary information embedded within multiple sequence alignments provides a rich source of data for inferring structural constraints on macromolecules. Still, many proteins of interest lack sufficient numbers of related sequences, leading to noisy, error-prone residue-residue contact predictions. Here we introduce DeepContact, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach that discovers co-evolutionary motifs and leverages these patterns to enable accurate inference of contact probabilities, particularly when few related sequences are available. DeepContact significantly improves performance over previous methods, including in the CASP12 blind contact prediction task where we achieved top performance with another CNN-based approach. Moreover, our tool converts hard-to-interpret coupling scores into probabilities, moving the field toward a consistent metric to assess contact prediction across diverse proteins. Through substantially improving the precision-recall behavior of contact prediction, DeepContact suggests we are near a paradigm shift in template-free modeling for protein structure prediction.},

abstract = {Profile hidden Markov models (profile-HMMs) are sensitive tools for remote protein homology detection, but the main scoring algorithms, Viterbi or Forward, require considerable time to search large sequence databases. We have designed a series of database filtering steps, HMMERHEAD, that are applied prior to the scoring algorithms, as implemented in the HMMER package, in an effort to reduce search time. Using this heuristic, we obtain a 20-fold decrease in Forward and a 6-fold decrease in Viterbi search time with a minimal loss in sensitivity relative to the unfiltered approaches. We then implemented an iterative profile-HMM search method, JackHMMER, which employs the HMMERHEAD heuristic. Due to our search heuristic, we eliminated the subdatabase creation that is common in current iterative profile-HMM approaches. On our benchmark, JackHMMER detects 14\% more remote protein homologs than SAM's iterative method T2K. Our search heuristic, HMMERHEAD, significantly reduces the time needed to score a profile-HMM against large sequence databases. This search heuristic allowed us to implement an iterative profile-HMM search method, JackHMMER, which detects significantly more remote protein homologs than SAM's T2K and NCBI's PSI-BLAST.},

abstract = {We have developed SPICKER, a simple and efficient strategy to identify near-native folds by clustering protein structures generated during computer simulations. In general, the most populated clusters tend to be closer to the native conformation than the lowest energy structures. To assess the generality of the approach, we applied SPICKER to 1489 representative benchmark proteins 200 residues that cover the PDB at the level of 35\% sequence identity; each contains up to 280,000 structure decoys generated using the recently developed TASSER (Threading ASSembly Refinement) algorithm. The best of the top five identified folds has a root-mean-square deviation from native (RMSD) in the top 1.4\% of all decoys. For 78\% of the proteins, the difference in RMSD from native to the identified models and RMSD from native to the absolutely best individual decoy is below 1 {\AA}; the majority belong to the targets with converged conformational distributions. Although native fold identification from divergent decoy structures remains a challenge, our overall results show significant improvement over our previous clustering algorithms.},

abstract = {Despite decades of work by structural biologists, there are still $\sim$5200 protein families with unknown structure outside the range of comparative modeling. We show that Rosetta structure prediction guided by residue-residue contacts inferred from evolutionary information can accurately model proteins that belong to large families and that metagenome sequence data more than triple the number of protein families with sufficient sequences for accurate modeling. We then integrate metagenome data, contact-based structure matching, and Rosetta structure calculations to generate models for 614 protein families with currently unknown structures; 206 are membrane proteins and 137 have folds not represented in the Protein Data Bank. This approach provides the representative models for large protein families originally envisioned as the goal of the Protein Structure Initiative at a fraction of the cost.},

abstract = {The prediction of interresidue contacts and distances from coevolutionary data using deep learning has considerably advanced protein structure prediction. Here, we build on these advances by developing a deep residual network for predicting interresidue orientations, in addition to distances, and a Rosetta-constrained energy-minimization protocol for rapidly and accurately generating structure models guided by these restraints. In benchmark tests on 13th Community-Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP13)- and Continuous Automated Model Evaluation (CAMEO)-derived sets, the method outperforms all previously described structure-prediction methods. Although trained entirely on native proteins, the network consistently assigns higher probability to de novo-designed proteins, identifying the key fold-determining residues and providing an independent quantitative measure of the "ideality" of a protein structure. The method promises to be useful for a broad range of protein structure prediction and design problems.},

@article{Kyte1982,
abstract = {A computer program that progressively evaluates the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of a protein along its amino acid sequence has been devised. For this purpose, a hydropathy scale has been composed wherein the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of each of the 20 amino acid side-chains is taken into consideration. The scale is based on an amalgam of experimental observations derived from the literature. The program uses a moving-segment approach that continuously determines the average hydropathy within a segment of predetermined length as it advances through the sequence. The consecutive scores are plotted from the amino to the carboxy terminus. At the same time, a midpoint line is printed that corresponds to the grand average of the hydropathy of the amino acid compositions found in most of the sequenced proteins. In the case of soluble, globular proteins there is a remarkable correspondence between the interior portions of their sequence and the regions appearing on the hydrophobic side of the midpoint line, as well as the exterior portions and the regions on the hydrophilic side. The correlation was demonstrated by comparisons between the plotted values and known structures determined by crystallography. In the case of membrane-bound proteins, the portions of their sequences that are located within the lipid bilayer are also clearly delineated by large uninterrupted areas on the hydrophobic side of the midpoint line. As such, the membrane-spanning segments of these proteins can be identified by this procedure. Although the method is not unique and embodies principles that have long been appreciated, its simplicity and its graphic nature make it a very useful tool for the evaluation of protein structures.},

Here, we focused on the characteristic enrichment of prolines in the middle of the outer $\alpha$-helices of importin-$\beta$. When these prolines were substituted with alanine, nuclear transport activity was reduced drastically in vivo and in vitro, and caused a severe defect in mitotic progression. These mutations did not alter the overall folding of the helical repeat or affect its interaction with cargo or the regulatory factor Ran. However, in vitro and in silico analyses revealed that the mutant lost structural flexibility and could not undergo rapid conformational changes when transferring from a hydrophilic to hydrophobic environment or vice versa. These findings reveal the essential roles of prolines in ensuring the structural flexibility and functional integrity of karyopherins.},

Here we show the NMR structure of a reduced-state mimic of archaeal CcdA, a protein that transfers electrons across the inner membrane, by using a redox-active NMR sample. The two cysteine positions in CcdA are separated by 20 {\AA}. Whereas one is accessible to the cytoplasm, the other resides in the protein core, thus implying that conformational exchange is required for periplasmic accessibility. In vivo mixed disulfide-trapping experiments validated the functional positioning of the cysteines, and in vitro accessibility results confirmed conformational exchange. Our NMR and functional data together show the existence of multiple conformational states and suggest a four-state model for relaying electrons from cytosolic to periplasmic redox substrates.},

@article{Duran2013,
abstract = {Helical membrane proteins such as transporters, receptors, or channels often exhibit structural symmetry. Symmetry is perfect in homo-oligomers consisting of two or more copies of the same protein chain. Intriguingly, in single chain membrane proteins, often internal pseudo-symmetry is observed, in particular in transporters and channels. In several cases single chain proteins with pseudo-symmetry exist, that share the fold with homo-oligomers suggesting evolutionary pathways that involve gene duplication and fusion. It has been hypothesized that such evolutionary pathways allow for the rapid development of large proteins with novel functionality. At the same time symmetry can be leveraged to recognize highly symmetric substrates such as ions. Here we review helical transporter proteins with an inverted two-fold pseudo-symmetry. In this special scenario the symmetry axis lies in the membrane plane. As a result, the putative ancestral monomeric protein would insert in both directions into the membrane and its open-to-the-inside and open-to-the-outside conformations would be structurally identical and iso-energetic, giving a possible evolutionary pathway to create a transporter protein that needs to flip between the two states.},

abstract = {Undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase (UppP) is an integral membrane protein that recycles the lipid carrier essential to the ongoing biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Individual building blocks of peptidoglycan are assembled in the cytoplasm on undecaprenyl phosphate (C55-P) before being flipped to the periplasmic face, where they are polymerized and transferred to the existing cell wall sacculus, resulting in the side product undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (C55-PP). Interruption of UppP's regeneration of C55-P from C55-PP leads to the buildup of cell wall intermediates and cell lysis. We present the crystal structure of UppP from Escherichia coli at 2.0 {\AA} resolution, which reveals the mechanistic basis for intramembranal phosphatase action and substrate specificity using an inverted topology repeat. In addition, the observation of key structural motifs common to a variety of cross membrane transporters hints at a potential flippase function in the specific relocalization of the C55-P product back to the cytosolic space.},

Currently, no reports on crystal structures of MFS antiporters in complex with their substrates exist. The E. coli MdfA transporter is a well-studied model system for biochemical analyses of multidrug-resistance MFS antiporters. Here, we report three crystal structures of MdfA-ligand complexes at resolutions up to 2.0 {\AA}, all in the inward-facing conformation. The substrate-binding site sits proximal to the conserved acidic residue, D34. Our mutagenesis studies support the structural observations of the substrate-binding mode and the notion that D34 responds to substrate binding by adjusting its protonation status. Taken together, our data unveil the substrate-binding mode of MFS antiporters and suggest a mechanism of transport via this group of transporters.},

abstract = {Bacterial resistance to antibiotics and biocides is an increasing public health problem. Genes encoding integral membrane proteins belonging to the DedA family are present in most bacterial genomes, including Escherichia coli. An E. coli strain lacking partially redundant DedA family genes yqjA and yghB (strain BC202) displays temperature sensitivity and cell division defects. These phenotypes can be corrected by overexpression of mdfA, an Na(+)-K(+)/H(+) antiporter of the major facilitator superfamily. We show that BC202 is hypersensitive to several biocides and cationic compounds that are known substrates of several multidrug resistance transporters, including MdfA, EmrE, and AcrB. The introduction of deletions of genes encoding these drug transporters into BC202 results in additional sensitivity. Expression of wild-type yghB or yqjA can restore drug resistance, but this is eliminated upon mutation of two membrane-embedded acidic amino acids (E39 or D51 in either protein). This dependence upon membrane-embedded acidic amino acids is a hallmark of proton-dependent antiporters. Overexpression of mdfA in BC202 or artificially restoring proton motive force (PMF) restores wild-type resistance to substrates of MdfA as well as other drug resistance transporters such as EmrE and AcrAB. These results suggest that YqjA and YghB may be membrane transporters required for PMF-dependent drug efflux in E. coli.},

abstract = {The degree of evolutionary conservation of an amino acid in a protein or a nucleic acid in DNA/RNA reflects a balance between its natural tendency to mutate and the overall need to retain the structural integrity and function of the macromolecule. The ConSurf web server (http://consurf.tau.ac.il), established over 15 years ago, analyses the evolutionary pattern of the amino/nucleic acids of the macromolecule to reveal regions that are important for structure and/or function. Starting from a query sequence or structure, the server automatically collects homologues, infers their multiple sequence alignment and reconstructs a phylogenetic tree that reflects their evolutionary relations. These data are then used, within a probabilistic framework, to estimate the evolutionary rates of each sequence position. Here we introduce several new features into ConSurf, including automatic selection of the best evolutionary model used to infer the rates, the ability to homology-model query proteins, prediction of the secondary structure of query RNA molecules from sequence, the ability to view the biological assembly of a query (in addition to the single chain), mapping of the conservation grades onto 2D RNA models and an advanced view of the phylogenetic tree that enables interactively rerunning ConSurf with the taxa of a sub-tree.},

It currently offers 34 interconnected external and in-house tools, whose functionality covers sequence similarity searching, alignment construction, detection of sequence features, structure prediction, and sequence classification. This breadth has made the Toolkit an important resource for experimental biology and for teaching bioinformatic inquiry. Recently, we replaced the first version of the Toolkit, which was released in 2005 and had served around 2.5 million queries, with an entirely new version, focusing on improved features for the comprehensive analysis of proteins, as well as on promoting teaching. For instance, our popular remote homology detection server, HHpred, now allows pairwise comparison of two sequences or alignments and offers additional profile HMMs for several model organisms and domain databases. Here, we introduce the new version of our Toolkit and its application to the analysis of proteins.},

@article{Remmert2012,
abstract = {are generally too slow for iteratively searching through large sequence databases such as UniProt or NCBI's nonredundant (nr) database. Here we present HMM-HMM-based lightning-fast iterative sequence search (HHblits), which extends HHsearch to enable fast, iterative sequence searches. The profile-profile alignment prefilter of HHblits reduces the number of full HMM-HMM alignments from many millions to a few thousand, making it faster than PSI-BLAST but still as sensitive as HHsearch (Supplementary Fig. 1). For iterative searches, HHblits needs a database of HMMs that covers the entire sequence space. We devised a very fast method, kClust (M. Hauser, C.E. Mayer and J.S., unpublished data), for clustering large sequence databases down to 20-30\% maximum pairwise sequence identity while requiring almost full-length alignability (>80\% coverage of longer sequences). This strict coverage criterion enriches for orthologous sequences with the same domain architecture 7 : of the UniProt20 clusters containing more than two Swiss-Prot sequences with enzyme commission numbers, 98.4\% had all four enzyme commission digits conserved (Supplementary Fig. 2). kClust is sufficiently fast ($\sim$1,000 times faster than BLAST) to allow for regular reclustering of the updated UniProt and nr databases. UniProt20 (the version from July 2011) contained 15 million sequences in 2.6 million HMMs, with an average of 5.5 sequences per cluster. HHblits first converts the query sequence (or MSA) to an HMM. This is conventionally done by adding pseudocounts of amino acids that are physicochemically similar to the amino acid in the query. In contrast, HHblits calculates pseudocounts that depend on the local sequence context (that is, the 13 positions around each residue). This method had improved the sensitivity and alignment quality of the resulting profile considerably 8. HHblits then searches the HMM database and adds the sequences from HMMs below a defined expected value (E value) threshold to the query MSA, from which the HMM for the next search iteration is built (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 3). For speed and sensitivity, the prefilter is crucial. The key idea was to implement profile-profile comparison as a sequence-to-profile comparison by discretizing the vectors of 20 amino acid probabilities in each HMM column into an alphabet of 219 letters. Each letter represents a typical profile column (Supplementary Fig. 4). We approximate the database HMMs by sequences over this extended alphabet, ignoring the insertion and deletion probabilities of the HMMs (Supplementary Fig. 5). Before prefiltering, we calculate the score of each query HMM column with each of the 219 letters, which results in a 219-row extended sequence profile. The prefiltering consists of two steps (Supplementary Fig. 3): (i) a very fast gapless local alignment between the extended query profile and the extended database sequences and (ii) a gapped sequence-based protein function and structure prediction depends crucially on sequence-search sensitivity and accuracy of the resulting sequence alignments. We present an open-source, general-purpose tool that represents both query and database sequences by profile hidden markov models (hmms): 'hmm-hmm-based lightning-fast iterative sequence search' (hhblits; http://toolkit.genzentrum.lmu.de/hhblits/). compared to the sequence-search tool Psi-bLast, hhblits is faster owing to its discretized-profile prefilter, has 50-100\% higher sensitivity and generates more accurate alignments. Building protein multiple-sequence alignments (MSAs) by iterative sequence searches is of fundamental importance in computational biology, as MSAs are a key intermediate step in the sequence-based prediction of evolutionarily conserved properties , such as tertiary structure, functional sites or interaction interfaces. Sequence profiles and profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) are condensed representations of MSAs that specify for each sequence position the probability of observing each of the 20 amino acids in evolutionarily related proteins. PSI-BLAST 1 , the most widely used iterative search tool, progressively refines a query sequence profile by adding statistically significant sequence matches to the profile for the next search iteration. The tools SAM2K (ref. 2) and HMMER3 (ref. 3) use profile HMMs for better sensitivity. Profile-profile and HMM-HMM alignment are the most sensitive classes of sequence-search methods. They are the methods of choice for identifying and aligning templates for three-dimensional homology modeling 4. Our HMM-HMM alignment method HHsearch 5 is used by many of the best protein structure prediction servers, among which is HHpred 6 , the top-ranked server for template-based protein structure prediction in last year's Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction exercise},

The TMDET algorithm can locate the spatial positions of transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayer as well. During the last 8 years not only the size of the PDBTM database has been steadily growing from ∼400 to 1700 entries but also new structural elements have been identified, in addition to the well-known $\alpha$-helical bundle and $\beta$-barrel structures. Numerous 'exotic' transmembrane protein structures have been solved since the first release, which has made it necessary to define these new structural elements, such as membrane loops or interfacial helices in the database. This article reports the new features of the PDBTM database that have been added since its first release, and our current efforts to keep the database up-to-date and easy to use so that it may continue to serve as a fundamental resource for the scientific community.},

Homologous relationships are typically established through sequence similarity searches, multiple alignments and phylogenetic reconstruction. In cases where the number of potential relationships is large, for example in P-loop NTPases with many thousands of members, alignments and phylogenies become computationally demanding, accumulate errors and lose resolution.

abstract = {Prostaglandin H2 synthase (PGHS) synthesizes PGH2, a prostaglandin precursor, from arachidonic acid and was the first monotopic enzyme to have its structure experimentally determined. Both isozymes of PGHS are inhibited by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, an important class of drugs that are the primary means of relieving pain and inflammation. Selectively inhibiting the second isozyme, PGHS-2, minimizes the gastrointestinal side-effects. This had been achieved by the new PGHS-2 selective NSAIDs (i.e., COX-2 inhibitors) but it has been recently suggested that they suffer from additional side-effects. The design of these drugs only made use of static structures from x-ray crystallographic experiments. Investigating the dynamics of both PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 using classical molecular dynamics is expected to generate new insight into the differences in behavior between the isozymes, and therefore may allow improved PGHS-2 selective inhibitors to be designed. We describe a molecular dynamics protocol that integrates PGHS monomers into phospholipid bilayers, thereby producing in silico atomistic models of the PGHS system. Our protocol exploits the vacuum created beneath the protein when several lipids are removed from the top leaflet of the bilayer. The protein integrates into the bilayer during the first 5 ns in a repeatable process. The integrated PGHS monomer is stable and forms multiple hydrogen bonds between the phosphate groups of the lipids and conserved basic residues (Arg, Lys) on the protein. These interactions stabilize the system and are similar to interactions observed for transmembrane proteins.},

abstract = {Proteins can be covalently modified with a variety of different lipids, including fatty acids, cholesterol, isoprenoids, phospholipids, and diacylglyceryl lipids. Proteins that are fatty acylated contain amide-linked myristate or thioester-linked palmitate. Alternative modes of fatty acid attachment include amide-linked palmitate (hedgehog proteins) or oxyester-linked palmitoleate or octanoate. Most prenylated proteins are small G proteins containing thioether-linked farnesyl or geranylgeranyl. More than one lipophilic group can be attached to a protein, for example, myristate+palmitate, farnesyl+palmitate or palmitate+cholesterol. In addition, larger and more complex structures are found in mammalian proteins modified with a phospholipid or with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor and in tri-fatty acylated bacterial lipoproteins. Each of these lipid modifications has been shown to regulate structure, localisation and/or function of the modified proteins.},

The ABCG5/ABCG8 heterodimer (G5G8) mediates excretion of neutral sterols in liver and intestines. Mutations disrupting G5G8 cause sitosterolaemia, a disorder characterized by sterol accumulation and premature atherosclerosis. Here we use crystallization in lipid bilayers to determine the X-ray structure of human G5G8 in a nucleotide-free state at 3.9 {\AA} resolution, generating the first atomic model of an ABC sterol transporter. The structure reveals a new transmembrane fold that is present in a large and functionally diverse superfamily of ABC transporters. The transmembrane domains are coupled to the nucleotide-binding sites by networks of interactions that differ between the active and inactive ATPases, reflecting the catalytic asymmetry of the transporter. The G5G8 structure provides a mechanistic framework for understanding sterol transport and the disruptive effects of mutations causing sitosterolaemia.},

abstract = {The similarity in the three-dimensional structures of homologous proteins imposes strong constraints on their sequence variability. It has long been suggested that the resulting correlations among amino acid compositions at different sequence positions can be exploited to infer spatial contacts within the tertiary protein structure. Crucial to this inference is the ability to disentangle direct and indirect correlations, as accomplished by the recently introduced direct-coupling analysis (DCA). Here we develop a computationally efficient implementation of DCA, which allows us to evaluate the accuracy of contact prediction by DCA for a large number of protein domains, based purely on sequence information. DCA is shown to yield a large number of correctly predicted contacts, recapitulating the global structure of the contact map for the majority of the protein domains examined. Furthermore, our analysis captures clear signals beyond intradomain residue contacts, arising, e.g., from alternative protein conformations, ligand-mediated residue couplings, and interdomain interactions in protein oligomers. Our findings suggest that contacts predicted by DCA can be used as a reliable guide to facilitate computational predictions of alternative protein conformations, protein complex formation, and even the de novo prediction of protein domain structures, contingent on the existence of a large number of homologous sequences which are being rapidly made available due to advances in genome sequencing.},

@article{Wu2020,
abstract = {Motivation: Deep learning has become the dominant technology for protein contact prediction. However, the factors that affect the performance of deep learning in contact prediction have not been systematically investigated. Results: We analyzed the results of our three deep learning-based contact prediction methods (MULTICOMCLUSTER, MULTICOM-CONSTRUCT and MULTICOM-NOVEL) in the CASP13 experiment and identified several key factors [i.e. deep learning technique, multiple sequence alignment (MSA), distance distribution prediction and domain-based contact integration] that influenced the contact prediction accuracy. We compared our convolutional neural network (CNN)-based contact prediction methods with three coevolution-based methods on 75 CASP13 targets consisting of 108 domains. We demonstrated that the CNN-based multi-distance approach was able to leverage global coevolutionary coupling patterns comprised of multiple correlated contacts for more accurate contact prediction than the local coevolution-based methods, leading to a substantial increase of precision by 19.2 percentage points. We also tested different alignment methods and domain-based contact prediction with the deep learning contact predictors. The comparison of the three methods showed deeper sequence alignments and the integration of domain-based contact prediction with the full-length contact prediction improved the performance of contact prediction. Moreover, we demonstrated that the domain-based contact prediction based on a novel ab initio approach of parsing domains from MSAs alone without using known protein structures was a simple, fast approach to improve contact prediction. Finally, we showed that predicting the distribution of inter-residue distances in multiple distance intervals could capture more structural information and improve binary contact prediction.

Here, we build on these advances by developing a deep residual network for predicting interresidue orientations, in addition to distances, and a Rosetta-constrained energy-minimization protocol for rapidly and accurately generating structure models guided by these restraints. In benchmark tests on 13th Community-Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP13)- and Continuous Automated Model Evaluation (CAMEO)-derived sets, the method outperforms all previously described structure-prediction methods. Although trained entirely on native proteins, the network consistently assigns higher probability to de novo-designed proteins, identifying the key fold-determining residues and providing an independent quantitative measure of the "ideality" of a protein structure. The method promises to be useful for a broad range of protein structure prediction and design problems.},

We benchmark the approach with blinded de novo computation of known transmembrane protein structures from 23 families, demonstrating unprecedented accuracy of the method for large transmembrane proteins. We show how the method can predict oligomerization, functional sites, and conformational changes in transmembrane proteins. With the rapid rise in large-scale sequencing, more accurate and more comprehensive information on evolutionary constraints can be decoded from genetic variation, greatly expanding the repertoire of transmembrane proteins amenable to modeling by this method.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a conserved pathway for bulk degradation of cytoplasmic material by a double-membrane structure named the autophagosome. The initiation of autophagosome formation requires the recruitment of autophagy-related protein 9 (ATG9) vesicles to the preautophagosomal structure. However, the functional relationship between ATG9 vesicles and the phagophore is controversial in different systems, and the molecular function of ATG9 remains unknown in plants. Here, we demonstrate that ATG9 is essential for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived autophagosome formation in plants. Through a combination of genetic, in vivo imaging and electron tomography approaches, we show that Arabidopsis ATG9 deficiency leads to a drastic accumulation of autophagosome-related tubular structures in direct membrane continuity with the ER upon autophagic induction. Dynamic analyses demonstrate a transient membrane association between ATG9 vesicles and the autophagosomal membrane during autophagy. Furthermore, trafficking of ATG18a is compromised in atg9 mutants during autophagy by forming extended tubules in a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-dependent manner. Taken together, this study provides evidence for a pivotal role of ATG9 in regulating autophagosome progression from the ER membrane in Arabidopsis.},

@article{Cheng2014,
abstract = {Understanding the evolution of a protein, including both close and distant relationships, often reveals insight into its structure and function. Fast and easy access to such up-to-date information facilitates research. We have developed a hierarchical evolutionary classification of all proteins with experimentally determined spatial structures, and presented it as an interactive and updatable online database. ECOD (Evolutionary Classification of protein Domains) is distinct from other structural classifications in that it groups domains primarily by evolutionary relationships (homology), rather than topology (or “fold”). This distinction highlights cases of homology between domains of differing topology to aid in understanding of protein structure evolution. ECOD uniquely emphasizes distantly related homologs that are difficult to detect, and thus catalogs the largest number of evolutionary links among structural domain classifications. Placing distant homologs together underscores the ancestral similarities of these proteins and draws attention to the most important regions of sequence and structure, as well as conserved functional sites. ECOD also recognizes closer sequence-based relationships between protein domains. Currently, approximately 100,000 protein structures are classified in ECOD into 9,000 sequence families clustered into close to 2,000 evolutionary groups. The classification is assisted by an automated pipeline that quickly and consistently classifies weekly releases of PDB structures and allows for continual updates. This synchronization with PDB uniquely distinguishes ECOD among all protein classifications. Finally, we present several case studies of homologous proteins not recorded in other classifications, illustrating the potential of how ECOD can be used to further biological and evolutionary studies.},

abstract = {Autophagy, fundamentally a lysosomal degradation pathway, functions in cells during normal growth and certain pathological conditions, including starvation, to maintain homeostasis. Autophagosomes are formed through a mechanism that is not well understood, despite the identification of many genes required for autophagy. We have studied the mammalian homologue of Atg9p, a multi-spanning transmembrane protein essential in yeast for autophagy, to gain a better understanding of the function of this ubiquitious protein. We show that both the N- and C-termini of mammalian Atg9 (mAtg9) are cytosolic, and predict that mAtg9 spans the membrane six times. We find that mAtg9 is located in the trans-Golgi network and late endosomes and colocalizes with TGN46, the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor, Rab7 and Rab9. Amino acid starvation or rapamycin treatment, which upregulates autophagy, causes a redistribution of mAtg9 from the TGN to peripheral, endosomal membranes, which are positive for the autophagosomal marker GFP-LC3. siRNA-mediated depletion of the putative mammalian homologue of Atg1p, ULK1, inhibits this starvation-induced redistribution. The redistribution of mAtg9 also requires PI 3-kinase activity, and is reversed after restoration of amino acids. We speculate that starvation-induced autophagy, which requires mAtg9, may rely on an alteration of the steady-state trafficking of mAtg9, in a Atg1-dependent manner.},

We have designed a series of database filtering steps, HMMERHEAD, that are applied prior to the scoring algorithms, as implemented in the HMMER package, in an effort to reduce search time. Using this heuristic, we obtain a 20-fold decrease in Forward and a 6-fold decrease in Viterbi search time with a minimal loss in sensitivity relative to the unfiltered approaches. We then implemented an iterative profile-HMM search method, JackHMMER, which employs the HMMERHEAD heuristic. Due to our search heuristic, we eliminated the subdatabase creation that is common in current iterative profile-HMM approaches. On our benchmark, JackHMMER detects 14\% more remote protein homologs than SAM's iterative method T2K. Our search heuristic, HMMERHEAD, significantly reduces the time needed to score a profile-HMM against large sequence databases. This search heuristic allowed us to implement an iterative profile-HMM search method, JackHMMER, which detects significantly more remote protein homologs than SAM's T2K and NCBI's PSI-BLAST.},

@article{Mitchell2019,
abstract = {<p>MGnify (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics) provides a free to use platform for the assembly, analysis and archiving of microbiome data derived from sequencing microbial populations that are present in particular environments. Over the past 2 years, MGnify (formerly EBI Metagenomics) has more than doubled the number of publicly available analysed datasets held within the resource. Recently, an updated approach to data analysis has been unveiled (version 5.0), replacing the previous single pipeline with multiple analysis pipelines that are tailored according to the input data, and that are formally described using the Common Workflow Language, enabling greater provenance, reusability, and reproducibility. MGnify's new analysis pipelines offer additional approaches for taxonomic assertions based on ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1/2) and expanded protein functional annotations. Biochemical pathways and systems predictions have also been added for assembled contigs. MGnify's growing focus on the assembly of metagenomic data has also seen the number of datasets it has assembled and analysed increase six-fold. The non-redundant protein database constructed from the proteins encoded by these assemblies now exceeds 1 billion sequences. Meanwhile, a newly developed contig viewer provides fine-grained visualisation of the assembled contigs and their enriched annotations.</p>},

@article{Jumper2021,
abstract = {<p> Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort <sup>1–4</sup> , the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined <sup>5</sup> , but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences <sup>6,7</sup> . Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem' <sup>8</sup> —has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years <sup>9</sup> . Despite recent progress <sup>10–14</sup> , existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14) <sup>15</sup> , demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm. </p>},
